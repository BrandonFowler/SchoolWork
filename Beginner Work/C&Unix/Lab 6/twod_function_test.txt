/*
Question 8: Yes I believe we can pass the array 
known as twod, to a function such as function4(twod, 4, 3), 
where the prototype is function4(int ** twod, int rows, int cols),
because twod is a double pointer type variable, and therefore
the function prototype should be correct for the type.
*/


/*
Question 9: When you use bracket notation you must pass the number
of columns using []. With the square brackets, calculations wil be done
for you, and the columns bracket signifys where to start.
With pointer notation no calculations are done for you. The pointer for
the start of the array is passed, and you must do the calculations yourself
treating the 2D array as one long array, using memory locations.
