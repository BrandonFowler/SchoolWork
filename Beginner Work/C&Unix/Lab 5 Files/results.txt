//The very last chunk of code I deleted because it did not work when compilling
//This is what I stated in my guess:
This line should cause an error. The address pf aptr will
be dereferenced giveing the int stored at that location. 4 will be
added to the int giving us a value of 24. Then it will attempt to store
another int at 24, which should cause problems.
