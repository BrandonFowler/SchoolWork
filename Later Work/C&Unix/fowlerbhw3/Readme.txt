Input directions

Input is hard coded to come from a file called "data.txt" with
no quotes.In order to enter your own values you must edit the 
provided data.txt or create a new text file of the same name. 
Data must be entered line by line in the correct order. The 
order is as follows:

processID
arrivalTimeStamp
totalBurstTime
priority

So an example of entering two processes could be:

1
0
5
2

2
1
9
3

Note: Higher value for priority, will be treated as higher
priority. In the above example process 2 has a higher
priority than process 1.
