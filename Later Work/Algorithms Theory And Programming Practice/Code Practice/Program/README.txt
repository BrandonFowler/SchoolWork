Programming Assignment

Place all source files in the same directory and compile them normally; 
then run FindTopTenThousand (contains main). Input should be given as a command line argument.
Output is in the form of a .txt file named "TopTenThousand.txt", and will be placed in the same
directory. The values are outputed in the order that they are stored in the
heapArray.(Sorted output order was not specified in the project instructions,
so I didn't not include a sorting feature.) 

Example for compile and run on command line, with all source files in current directory:

javac *.java 

java FindTopTenThousand data.txt
